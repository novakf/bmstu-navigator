/**
 * @file ext-storage.js
 *
 * This extension allows automatic saving of the SVG canvas contents upon
 *  page unload (which can later be automatically retrieved upon future
 *  editor loads).
 *
 *  The functionality was originally part of the SVG Editor, but moved to a
 *  separate extension to make the setting behavior optional, and adapted
 *  to inform the user of its setting of local data.

 * @todo Revisit on whether to use `svgEditor.pref` over directly setting
 * `curConfig` in all extensions for a more public API (not only for `extPath`
 * and `imagePath`, but other currently used config in the extensions)
 * @todo We might provide control of storage settings through the UI besides the
 *   initial (or URL-forced) dialog. *
