 * This extension provides for the addition of markers to the either end
 * or the middle of a line, polyline, path, polygon.
 *
 * Markers are graphics
 *
 * to simplify the coding and make the implementation as robust as possible,
 * markers are not shared - every object has its own set of markers.
 * this relationship is maintained by a naming convention between the
 * ids of the markers and the ids of the object
 *
 * The following restrictions exist for simplicty of use and programming
 *    objects and their markers to have the same color
 *    marker size is fixed
 *    an application specific attribute - se_type - is added to each marker element
 *        to store the type of marker
 *
 * @todo
 *    remove some of the restrictions above
 *
